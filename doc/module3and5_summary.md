# ðŸ§  GitHub Copilot Prompt Engineering â€“ Summary

## 1. Structure
- The Prompt Engineering is divided into two modules:
  - **Core Techniques**
  - **Advanced Prompting**

## 2. Format
- Each concept is taught in a 7â€“8 minute hands-on segment.
- We use a **Flask Todo App** as the base project.
- Each module is demonstrated on a separate Git branch.
- Each technique has Good and Bad prompts.

## 3. Demo-Driven Learning
- For every prompting style, we implement a **real feature** in the Todo app and run it locally.

## ðŸš€ Module 2: Advanced Prompting
### ðŸ”¹ Chain-of-Thought Prompting
- **Feature**: Implement **search functionality** step-by-step.

### ðŸ”¹ Mega-Prompts
- **Feature**: Add **user authentication** with multiple sub-tasks.

### ðŸ”¹ Adaptive Prompting / Self-Refinement
